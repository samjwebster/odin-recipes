    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear, unscratched vessel to hold the liquid</li>
        <li>Unfiltered spring water</li>
        <li>Long-forgotten childhood memories</li>
        <li>Animal tears (preferably rodent)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of crushed maple leaf</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous trinkets</li>
        <li>Potent dandelion seeds</li>
        <li>1-2 orbs of light</li>
        <li>Feathers of a bird that doesn't yet exist</li>
        <li>Patience</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preparing your vessel. Rinse the inside using an even mixture of spring water and animal tears. </li>
        <li>Ponder the childhood memories for 3-5 minutes. Fresher memories concoct a longer-lasting potion.</li>
        <li>Perform a genetic test on the feathers to ensure that the bird they are from has yet to exist. Note: feathers from a bird that <strong>does</strong> exist will cause you to cease existing. <strong>Proceed with caution!</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Brewing</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the 1/4 cup of crushed maple leaf and a sprinkle of potent dandelion seeds. Shake vigorously. Stop when evenly mixed to avoid pulping during brewing process.</li>
        <li>Place your vessel onto a flat surface. Arrange the miscellaneous trinkets around the vessel in a geometric shape of your choosing.</li>
        <li>Begin drizzling the maple-dandelion mixture with the animal tears. Once the trinkets begin to float, stop pouring.</li>
        <li>Without disturbing the floating trinkets, begin adding unfiltered spring water. The trinkets should now start lowering down. Cease pouring spring water as soon as they touch down to the surface.</li>
        <li>Collect the trinkets and burn them. (Feel free to complete this step <em>after</em> brewing!)</li>
        <li>Around the vessel, add your orbs of light (to taste). Allow the concoction to absorb the light for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After absorption is completed, drape a tattered cloth over the orbs of light. Place your vessel into a dark cabinet. Lock it from the inside and burn the key.</li>
        <li>Wait 1-3 years. Once completed, the cabinet will unlock itself.</li>
        <li>Viola! Now enjoy your perfect slightly unstable potion!</li>
    </ol>
