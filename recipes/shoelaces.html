    <h1>Spiritually-charged Shoelaces</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Do you dream of running fast? What about jumping high? Have you ever tripped in public over your own shoelaces? Or maybe just wished your shoelaces had sentience? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then Spiritually-charged Shoelaces are the perfect weekend DIY project for you!</p>
    <p><strong>A note from the author:</strong> the anonymous group heading the Spiritually-charged Shoelace project has been historically attacked by members of the Liaison Of Shoelace Ergonomics Realists. If you are assaulted, insulted, or in any other way persecuted by someone who appears to be a L.O.S.E.R, please email us at <em>shoelaceluvers@shoemail.com</em>.</p>
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A container holding both spirits to be charged into your shoelaces (purchase it on our website!)</li>
        <li>A choice pair of shoelaces</li>
        <li>A passion for shoe-related activities</li>
        <li>A <em>spiritual-connector</em> (any person with the ability to connect with local spirits)</li>
        <li>An extra person</li>
        <li>Incredible mental fortitude</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the shoelaces from your shoes and clean them.</li>
        <li>The spiritual-connector must now chant a cleansing call over the shoelaces. In the case of an evil spirit living in the shoelaces, follow the instructions of your spiritual-connector on how to deal with it properly</li>
        <li>Once cleansed, the shoelaces will feel extremely spiritually tempting. It is important that you don't allow your own spirit to exit your body and enter the now vacant shoelaces.</li>
        <li>Individually extend each shoelace between your and your extra person's hands.</li>
        <li>The spiritual-connector can now open the spirit container and add the spirits to each shoelace in the conduiting ritual outlined in the contained pamphlet.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your new Spiritually-charged Shoelaces!</li>
    </ol>
